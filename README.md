## About

Most portfolio sites are static one-pagers with a resume bolted on. This one is built as a small React application on purpose — full bilingual support (PT/EN) with auto-detection, persisted theme preference, and a terminal-inspired hero meant to signal the kind of engineer behind it before a recruiter reads a single word.

<!-- Adjust this paragraph to your actual motivation — this is a draft based on the feature list, not your own words. -->

## Demo

<!-- Add the live link and, ideally, a screenshot or short GIF of the terminal hero animation — this is a web project, so Demo isn't optional the way it is for an API. -->

**Why this shape:** CSS Modules over Tailwind/styled-components keeps styling scoped per component with zero runtime cost — no CSS-in-JS overhead for a site that's mostly static content. Theme and language live in React Context rather than a state library, since both are small, low-frequency, app-wide values — a full store would be overkill. Active-section highlighting in the nav uses `IntersectionObserver` (`useActiveSection`) instead of a router, since the whole site is a single scrollable page rather than distinct routed views.

**Known limitations:**
- No automated tests yet.
- Translations live as hand-written objects per language (`i18n/pt.ts`, `i18n/en.ts`) rather than an external i18n framework — fine at two languages, would need a real library beyond that.
- Certificate PDFs render inline via modal; very large files may be slow to load on mobile.
